  Weight: 1
   Project will start Jan 11, 2024 6:00 AM, must end by Jan 16, 2024 6:00 AM
    Checker will be released at Jan 15, 2024 6:00 PM
     Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done with the project)
      An auto review will be launched at the deadline
      Background Context
      The AirBnB project is a big part of the Higher level curriculum. This project will help you be ready for it.

      In this project, you will review everything about Python:

      Import
      Exceptions
      Class
      Private attribute
      Getter/Setter
      Class method
      Static method
      Inheritance
      Unittest
      Read/Write file
      You will also learn about:

      args and kwargs
      Serialization/Deserialization
      JSON
      Resources
      Read or watch:

      args/kwargs
      JSON encoder and decoder
      unittest module
      Python test cheatsheet
      Learning Objectives
      At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

      General
      What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
      How to serialize and deserialize a Class
      How to write and read a JSON file
      What is *args and how to use it
      What is **kwargs and how to use it
      How to handle named arguments in a function
      Copyright - Plagiarism
      You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
      You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else‚Äôs work.
      You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
      Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
      Requirements
      Python Scripts
      Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
      All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
      All your files should end with a new line
      The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
      A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
      Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
      All your files must be executable
      The length of your files will be tested using wc
      All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
      All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
      All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
      A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
      Python Unit Tests
      Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
      All your files should end with a new line
      All your test files should be inside a folder tests
      You have to use the unittest module
      All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
      All your test files and folders should start with test_
      Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
      All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
      You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
      We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don‚Äôt miss any edge case
      Tasks
      0. If it's not tested it doesn't work
      mandatory
      All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.

      guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ python3 -m unittest discover tests

      OK

      Note that this is just an example. The number of tests you create can be different from the above example.

      Repo:

      GitHub repository: alx-higher_level_programming
      Directory: 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle
      File: tests/
        
	1. Base class
	mandatory
	Write the first class Base:

	Create a folder named models with an empty file __init__.py inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package

	Create a file named models/base.py:

	Class Base:
	private class attribute __nb_objects = 0
	class constructor: def __init__(self, id=None)::
	if id is not None, assign the public instance attribute id with this argument value - you can assume id is an integer and you don‚Äôt need to test the type of it
	otherwise, increment __nb_objects and assign the new value to the public instance attribute id
	This class will be the ‚Äúbase‚Äù of all other classes in this project. The goal of it is to manage id attribute in all your future classes and to avoid duplicating the same code (by extension, same bugs)

	guillaume@ubuntu:~/$ cat 0-main.py
	#!/usr/bin/python3
	""" 0-main """
	from models.base import Base

	if __name__ == "__main__":
